    <h1>About WeGo</h1>
    <h2>
        Stay connected, stay safe, and make every meetup a breeze with WeGo. Join our community and never lose touch, no matter where you are in the world. Here in WeGo we believe that the world is meant to be explored, but never alone. Our story begins with a simple idea: making the vast world a smaller, safer, and more connected place. 

	WeGo was founded in 2023 by Crisha Campomayor and Boushra Alkie, two individuals who often found themselves getting lost even in their own city, Zamboanga City but the main idea is to ensure everyone goes and arrive asafely to their destinations. Both individual wants an easy way to connect with their friends and family. From their personal need, the vision for WeGo was born.
    <br>Thank you for being a part of the WeGo family. Let's explore, connect, and stay close, no matter the distance.<br>
