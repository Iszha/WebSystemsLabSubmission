    <h1>Here are some of our Features!</h1>
    <h2><br>Location History:</h2><h3>View a daily calendar of your contacts arrivals and departures. You may quickly examine previous journeys and even track how much time you and your registered contacts spend in various areas.<br></h3>
        <h2><br>SOS Alert:</h2> <h3>If you ever experience a crisis or feel uncomfortable, SOS will transmit your location and a silent help alert to your Circle and emergency contacts.<br></h3>
        <h2><br>Crash Detection:</h2> <h3>This can detect crashes going over 25 mph. If you've been in an automobile accident, our safety function uses the sensors on your device to detect it and sends a location-based alert to your emergency contacts.<br></h3>
        <h2><br>Low Battery Notification :</h2> <h3>WeGo can show each Circle member's battery level and can send an alert when a Circle member's battery level is low, allowing you to rest comfortable and worry-free.<br></h3>
        <h2><br>Driver Reports:</h2><h3> Consolation while you're not in the car. View the performance of the drivers in your Circle this past week.  In order to identify the family member that drives the safest, the WeGo Driver report contains an assessment for each drive that considers high speed, phone usage, hard braking, and rapid acceleration in addition to a driver score.<br></h3>
        <h2><br>Bubbles:</h2> <h3>all need to do our own thing once in a while. You can have a little privacy by using a Bubble, which only displays your general position for a predetermined amount of time. While all safety protections remain on, only your general location will be visible to your Circle.</p><br></h3>
